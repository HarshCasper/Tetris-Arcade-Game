## Introduction 

Tetris AKA TET–ØIS was developed by the Soviet Programmer Alexey Pajitnov which consists of a field of play in which pieces 
of different geometric forms, called "tetriminos", descend from the top of the field. During this descent, the player can move the 
pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or 
land on a piece that had been placed before it. The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many 
horizontal lines of blocks as possible. When a line is completed, 
it disappears, and the blocks placed above fall one rank. The game never ends with the player's victory; the player can only complete as much lines as possible before an 
inevitable loss. [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)

## Technology Stack

- Java Programming Language: Java is an Object Oriented language and is one of the most popular programming language in the world and is primarily used to develop client and server applications. The introduction of MIDlets, applications that use the Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) which are executed on a Java Virtual machine (JVM) allows the abstraction of hardware on the on the smartphone and allows developers 
to build applications that run on devices that support Java runtime. 

- JavaFX: JavaFX is a Java library used to develop Desktop applications as well as Rich Internet Applications (RIA). The applications built in JavaFX, can run on multiple platforms including Web, Mobile and Desktops. JavaFX is intended to replace swing in Java applications as a GUI framework.
